/* Using xatoi() instead of naive atoi() is not always convenient -

 * in signed int. Therefore we need this one:
 * dies if input is not in [0, INT_MAX] range. Also will reject '-0' etc.
 * It should really be named xatoi_nonnegative (since it allows 0),
 * but that would be too long.

 * for BusyBox since we want to avoid using the glibc NSS stuff, which

 * Returns (-1) terminated malloced result of getgroups().
 * Reallocs group_array (useful for repeated calls).
 * ngroups is an initial size of array. It is rounded up to 32 for realloc.
 * ngroups is updated on return.
 * ngroups can be NULL: bb_getgroups(NULL, NULL) is valid usage.
 * Dies on errors (on Linux, only xrealloc can cause this, not internal getgroups call).

/* BB_EXECxx always execs (it's not doing NOFORK/NOEXEC stuff),

/* wait4pid: unlike waitpid, waits ONLY for one process.
 * Returns sig + 0x180 if child is killed by signal.
 * It's safe to pass negative 'pids' from failed [v]fork -
 * wait4pid will return -1 (and will not clobber [v]fork's errno).
 * IOW: rc = wait4pid(spawn(argv));
 *      if (rc < 0) bb_perror_msg("%s", argv[0]);

 * Thus bb_daemonize_or_rexec may cause your <applet>_main() to be re-executed

 * You have to audit carefully that you don't do something twice as a result
 * (opening files/sockets, parsing config files etc...)!

 * Both of the above will redirect fd 0,1,2 to /dev/null and drop ctty

 * fork_or_rexec(argv) = bare-bones fork on MMU,
 *      "vfork + re-exec ourself" on NOMMU. No fd redirection, no setsid().
 *      On MMU ignores argv.

 * Helper for network daemons in foreground mode:
 *
 * bb_sanitize_stdio() = make sure that fd 0,1,2 are opened by opening them
 * to /dev/null if they are not.

 * that optind be set to zero to reset its state.  BSD-derived versions
 * of getopt() misbehaved if optind is set to 0 in order to reset getopt(),
 * and glibc's getopt() used to coredump if optind is set 1 in order
 * to reset getopt().
 * Then BSD introduced additional variable "optreset" which should be
 * set to 1 in order to reset getopt().  Sigh.  Standards, anyone?
 *
 * By ~2008, OpenBSD 3.4 was changed to survive glibc-like optind = 0
 * (to interpret it as if optreset was set).
