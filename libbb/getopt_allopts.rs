/* Using xatoi() instead of naive atoi() is not always convenient -
 * in many places people want *non-negative* values, but store them
 * in signed int. Therefore we need this one:
 * dies if input is not in [0, INT_MAX] range. Also will reject '-0' etc.
 * It should really be named xatoi_nonnegative (since it allows 0),
 * but that would be too long.
 */
/* Useful for reading port numbers */
/* These parse entries in /etc/passwd and /etc/group.  This is desirable
 * for BusyBox since we want to avoid using the glibc NSS stuff, which
 * increases target size and is often not needed on embedded systems.  */
/* wrapper: allows string to contain numeric uid or gid */
/* always sets uid and gid; returns 0 on failure */

/* internally usernames are saved in fixed-sized char[] buffers */
/*
 * Returns (-1) terminated malloced result of getgroups().
 * Reallocs group_array (useful for repeated calls).
 * ngroups is an initial size of array. It is rounded up to 32 for realloc.
 * ngroups is updated on return.
 * ngroups can be NULL: bb_getgroups(NULL, NULL) is valid usage.
 * Dies on errors (on Linux, only xrealloc can cause this, not internal getgroups call).
 */
/* BB_EXECxx always execs (it's not doing NOFORK/NOEXEC stuff),
 * but it may exec busybox and call applet instead of searching PATH.
 */
/* xvfork() can't be a _function_, return after vfork in child mangles stack
 * in the parent. It must be a macro. */
/* NOMMU friendy fork+exec: */
/* wait4pid: unlike waitpid, waits ONLY for one process.
 * Returns sig + 0x180 if child is killed by signal.
 * It's safe to pass negative 'pids' from failed [v]fork -
 * wait4pid will return -1 (and will not clobber [v]fork's errno).
 * IOW: rc = wait4pid(spawn(argv));
 *      if (rc < 0) bb_perror_msg("%s", argv[0]);
 *      if (rc > 0) bb_error_msg("exit code: %d", rc & 0xff);

 * bb_daemonize(flags) = daemonize, does not compile on NOMMU
 *
 * bb_daemonize_or_rexec(flags, argv) = daemonizes on MMU (and ignores argv),
 *      rexec's itself on NOMMU with argv passed as command line.
 * Thus bb_daemonize_or_rexec may cause your <applet>_main() to be re-executed
 * from the start. (It will detect it and not reexec again second time).
 * You have to audit carefully that you don't do something twice as a result
 * (opening files/sockets, parsing config files etc...)!
 *
 * Both of the above will redirect fd 0,1,2 to /dev/null and drop ctty
 * (will do setsid()).
 *
 * fork_or_rexec(argv) = bare-bones fork on MMU,
 *      "vfork + re-exec ourself" on NOMMU. No fd redirection, no setsid().
 *      On MMU ignores argv.
 *
 * Helper for network daemons in foreground mode:
 *
 * bb_sanitize_stdio() = make sure that fd 0,1,2 are opened by opening them
 * to /dev/null if they are not.
