SPOOLDIR [HELPER [ARGS]]

SPOOLDIR must contain (symlinks to) device nodes or directories
with names matching print queue names. In the first case, jobs are
sent directly to the device. Otherwise each job is stored in queue
directory and HELPER program is called. Name of file to print
is passed in $DATAFILE variable.
Example:
	tcpsvd -E 0 515 softlimit -m 999999 lpd /var/spool ./print
