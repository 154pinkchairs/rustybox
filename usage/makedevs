[-d device_table] rootdir

Create a range of special files as specified in a device table.
Device table entries take the form of:
<name> <type> <mode> <uid> <gid> <major> <minor> <start> <inc> <count>
Where name is the file name, type can be one of:
	f	Regular file
	d	Directory
	c	Character device
	b	Block device
	p	Fifo (named pipe)
uid is the user id for the target file, gid is the group id for the
target file. The rest of the entries (major, minor, etc) apply to
to device special files. A '-' may be used for blank entries.
