[-hEv] [-c N] [-C N[:MSG]] [-b N] [-u USER] [-l NAME] IP PORT PROG

Create TCP socket, bind to IP:PORT and listen for incoming connections.
Run PROG for each connection.

	IP PORT		IP:PORT to listen on
	PROG ARGS	Program to run
	-u USER[:GRP]	Change to user/group after bind
	-c N		Up to N connections simultaneously (default 30)
	-b N		Allow backlog of approximately N TCP SYNs (default 20)
	-C N[:MSG]	Allow only up to N connections from the same IP:
			new connections from this IP address are closed
			immediately, MSG is written to the peer before close
	-E		Don't set up environment
	-h		Look up peer's hostname
	-l NAME		Local hostname (else look up local hostname in DNS)
	-v		Verbose

Environment if no -E:
PROTO='TCP'
TCPREMOTEADDR='ip:port' ('[ip]:port' for IPv6)
TCPLOCALADDR='ip:port'
TCPORIGDSTADDR='ip:port' of destination before firewall
	Useful for REDIRECTed-to-local connections:
	iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to 8080
TCPCONCURRENCY=num_of_connects_from_this_ip
If -h:
TCPLOCALHOST='hostname' (-l NAME is used if specified)
TCPREMOTEHOST='hostname'
