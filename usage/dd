Copy a file with converting and formatting

	if=FILE		Read from FILE instead of stdin
	of=FILE		Write to FILE instead of stdout
	bs=N		Read and write N bytes at a time
	ibs=N		Read N bytes at a time
	obs=N		Write N bytes at a time
	count=N		Copy only N input blocks
	skip=N		Skip N input blocks
	seek=N		Skip N output blocks
	conv=notrunc	Don't truncate output file
	conv=noerror	Continue after read errors
	conv=sync	Pad blocks with zeros
	conv=fsync	Physically write data out before finishing
	conv=swab	Swap every pair of bytes
	iflag=skip_bytes	skip=N is in bytes
	iflag=fullblock	Read full blocks
	oflag=seek_bytes	seek=N is in bytes
	oflag=append	Open output file in append mode
	status=noxfer	Suppress rate output
	status=none	Suppress all output

N may be suffixed by c (1), w (2), b (512), kB (1000), k (1024), MB, M, GB, G
