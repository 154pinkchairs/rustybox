[-s] | [-df]

mdev -s is to be run during boot to scan /sys and populate /dev.
mdev -d[f]: daemon, listen on netlink.
	-f: stay in foreground.

Bare mdev is a kernel hotplug helper. To activate it:
	echo /sbin/mdev >/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug

It uses /etc/mdev.conf with lines
	[-][ENV=regex;]...DEVNAME UID:GID PERM [>|=PATH]|[!] [@|$|*PROG]
where DEVNAME is device name regex, @major,minor[-minor2], or
environment variable regex. A common use of the latter is
to load modules for hotplugged devices:
	$MODALIAS=.* 0:0 660 @modprobe "$MODALIAS"

If /dev/mdev.seq file exists, mdev will wait for its value
to match $SEQNUM variable. This prevents plug/unplug races.
To activate this feature, create empty /dev/mdev.seq at boot.

If /dev/mdev.log file exists, debug log will be appended to it.
